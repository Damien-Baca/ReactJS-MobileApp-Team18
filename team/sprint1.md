## Retrospective

#### What went well
Everyone in our team adapted to the Git workflow of generating Epics and Issues, then generating Branches
related to issues, then generating pull requests for review and merging. Our team seems to be in the Forming
stage, we are getting used to each other's work styles. Our team seems to be getting along well, there were
not any conflicts about work assignment.

#### Potential improvements
Starting our work earlier would help, but it wasn't a huge problem. We need to find good out of class
meeting times for all of our team mates. We need to decide how we want to break down Epics for future
sprints.

#### What we will change next time
We will start our work earlier. We will make a calender that will allow us to set up meeting outside
of class more easily. We will discuss how best to break down Epics into manageable Tasks.
