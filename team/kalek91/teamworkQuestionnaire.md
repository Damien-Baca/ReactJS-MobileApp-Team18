# Teamwork Questionnaire for Christopher Abelein

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   Text
   
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   I expect our team to work reasonably well together and get an A
   
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   I have only done 1 collaborative software engineering project before, so learning to properly communicate
   for engineering projects and use GitHub.
   
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   Scheduling issues, a bit of trouble if the way we approach writing programs is drastically different.
   
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   I expect the difference in work ethic may be accounted for in individual scoring.
   
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   Ideally the person doing more work would get a higher grade than those who don't. Failing that,
   i would say it is to an extent.
   
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   About 20 hours per week.
   
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   We can discuss how we're going to approach building the parts of the program,
   and hopefully people will notice parts they might understand and take them.
   Otherwise the parts will likely just be assigned.
   
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   A direct discussion with that person, and notifying Dave Matthews that the person has failed to complete
   their assigned portion.
   
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   We can discuss how and why the quality of the work is a problem. Depending on
   whether or not an agreement can be reached and the exact quality of the work,
   we may also need to invole an instructor in the discussion.
   
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   Differences in work habits are only an issue if those habits interfere with the
   performance of the team. As long as this isn't the case, they aren't an issue.
   
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   I would like to have a weekly team meeting, schedules permitting.

1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   Once per week will probably be enough, unless a team member is struggling with
   something. In that case we can see about additional meetings.
   
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   Not necessarilt the entire team, but preferably the majority of the team.
   
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   It depends on the probelm in question, but likely we would go with
   the majority.
   
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   Ideally the other members could just tell that person and get them to tone it down.
   
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   First I would bring it up with the team. If it continues, I would talk with an instructor about it.
