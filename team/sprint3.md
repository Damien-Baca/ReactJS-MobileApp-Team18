# Sprint 3 - *T18* - *THE FIGHTING MONGOOSES*

## Goal

### Shorter trips to more places!
### Sprint Leader: *Long Chen*

## Definition of Done

* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>3.0</version>` for your final build for deployment.
* Increment release `v3.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name.
* Increment `server-3.0.jar` deployed for testing and demonstration on SPRINT3 assignment.
* Sprint Review, Restrospective, and Metrics completed (team/sprint3.md).


## Policies

#### Mobile First Design!
* Design for mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop (in that order).
* Use ReactStrap for a consistent interface (no HTML, CSS, style, etc.).
* Must adhere to the TripCo Interchange Protocol (TIP) for interoperability and testing.
#### Clean Code
* Code Climate maintainability of A or B.
* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
#### Test Driven Development
* Write method headers, unit tests, and code in that order.
* Unit tests are fully automated.
* Code Coverage above 40%
#### Configuration Management
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* All commits include a task/issue number.
* All commits include tests for the added or modified code.
* All tests pass.
#### Continuous Integration / Delivery 
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests all pull requests for master branch.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.  Do not load external libraries in your repo. 


## Plan

This sprint will complete the following Epics.

* *#0 epic title: description*
* *#162 Tip V3: TripCo The server must support the TIP version 3 specification.*
* *#74 Short trip: User: I would like the tool to rearrange my trip for me to make it short so I have will have less travel time.
                  Use the nearest-neighbor construction algorithm to build a shorter trip.
                  Pick the shortest of the possible trips starting from each possible location.
                  Show the resulting trip starting from the original starting location.*

***Key planning decisions for this sprint3: 
    1: We discussed the 5 required epics, which is main goal for this sprint
    2: We distributed the 5 epics to 24 tasks
    3: Each teammate chose some epics or tasks
    4: We also talked about bugs from previous sprint
    5: We also want to do some tests for many implications***
