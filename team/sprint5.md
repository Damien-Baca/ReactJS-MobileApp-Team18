#### Clean Code
* Code Climate maintainability of A (technical debt ratio <= 5).
* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
#### Test Driven Development
* Write unit tests before code.
* Unit tests are fully automated.
* Code Coverage above 60%
#### Configuration Management
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* All commits include a task/issue number.
* All commits include tests for the added or modified code.
* All tests pass.
#### Continuous Integration / Delivery 
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* All pull requests build and test with no failures.
