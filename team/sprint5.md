# Sprint 5 - T18 - THE FIGHTING MONGOOSES

## Goal

### Mobile release with a beautiful user experience!
### Sprint Leader: Damien Baca

## Definition of Done

* Version in pom.xml should be **`<version>5.0</version>`** for your final build for deployment.
* Increment release **`v5.0`** created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name.
* Increment **`server-5.0.jar`** deployed for testing and demonstration on SPRINT5 assignment.
* Sprint Review, Restrospective, and Metrics completed (**team/sprint5.md**).


## Policies

#### Mobile First Design!
* Design for mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop (in that order).
* Use ReactStrap for a consistent interface (no HTML, CSS, style, etc.).
* Must adhere to the TripCo Interchange Protocol (TIP) for interoperability and testing.
#### Clean Code
* Code Climate maintainability of A (technical debt ratio <= 5).
* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
#### Test Driven Development
* Write unit tests before code.
* Unit tests are fully automated.
* Code Coverage above 60%
#### Configuration Management
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* All commits include a task/issue number.
* All commits include tests for the added or modified code.
* All tests pass.
#### Continuous Integration / Delivery 
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* All pull requests build and test with no failures.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.  Do not load external libraries in your repo. 


## Plan

This sprint will complete the following Epics.

* #358 Ease of Use: Make the application easier to use.
* #359 Auto Optimization: Let the system automatically optimize trips, as long as the response time is very fast.
* #265 Save Map: Save the map to KML and SVG
* #360 Shortest Trip: Optimize for the shortest possible trips.
* #269 Map Clutter: Implement features that make the map easier to understand.
* #370 TIP V5: Update version info and json schemas.
